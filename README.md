# 🛒 E-commerce Sales Analysis using Python & MySQL

Welcome to this project 👋
This repository contains an end-to-end data analytics workflow built on an e-commerce transactional dataset. The project demonstrates how raw CSV data can be transformed into a structured relational database and analyzed using SQL to generate meaningful business insights.

---

## ✨ Project Overview

The objective of this project is to simulate a real-world analytics workflow that includes data ingestion, cleaning, storage, and analysis. Using Python and MySQL, the project builds a pipeline that converts raw data into actionable insights related to customer behavior, sales performance, and revenue trends.
